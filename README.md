# Stratum UI

**Stratum UI** takes its name from geological strata — the layered foundation of the earth. In much the same way, modern user interfaces are layered: visual design sits atop deeply structured, often invisible behavior.

This toolkit exists to power that behavioral layer — a headless, accessible, and framework-independent engine for dialogs, drawers, popovers, tooltips, and more. Whether you’re building a design system, custom component library, or multi-framework UI layer, **Stratum UI** helps you architect with confidence, from the bottom up.
